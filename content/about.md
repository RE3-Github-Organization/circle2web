  content_markdown: "Squared Circle Security is an upstart IT and Information Security
    consultancy. While we're still new and gearing up, we actually combine decades
    of hands-on experience supporting enterprise level clients. We know the security
    landscape because we've done our proverbial time in the cyber trenches defending
    and designing security solutions for both private and public sector customers.
    \ \n\nWe've always felt a strong need to be able to deliver and show value - both
    when it comes to security solution investments and their actual security output
    - and for a long while we've felt like the industry was missing some crucial steps
    before and after solution implementation and that is what we're aiming to rectify
    with our offerings. \n \nQuite simply, we want to be able to give our customers
    the tools and know-how to quantify, measure and manage their Security Operations
    challenges."

team_section: Our team has been the industry's standard ever since the 1500s, when
  an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
  book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
  typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
  the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
  with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
  Ipsum.

Square the circle. Many of us facing modern Cybersecurity issues can probably relate to the ancient problem of squaring the circle, as the ever changing threat landscape is seemingly impossible to square off and our best efforts end up with approximations.

Squared Circle Security is your partner set to collaborate and create your custom solution â€“ one that can grow with you and pivot fast when things change.
