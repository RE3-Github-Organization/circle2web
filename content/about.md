- title: Our Story
  content_markdown: "We're an upstart IT- and Information Security consultancy based
    in Gothenburg and Stockholm, Sweden. While still new and gearing up, we combine
    decades of hands-on experience supporting the security needs of enterprise level
    clients.     \n  \nWe've always felt a strong need to be able to deliver and show
    value in everything we do, especially when it comes to security solution investments
    and their actual security output. We've felt like the security industry was missing
    crucial steps before and after solution implementation and that is what we're
    aiming to rectify with our offerings.   \n   \nQuite simply; we want to be able
    to give our customers the tools and know-how to quantify, measure and manage their
    Security Operations challenges."

  content_markdown: "Information Security is full of truisms that often lead to very
    short lived trends  of point solutions that try to \"solve\" a specific security
    conundrum. As years roll by, the stack of solutions grows, but at the core \n
    \ \n- test bullet\n- next test bullet\n\nsimpler than it seems. At Circle2 our
    mission is to unravel the fears, uncertiditudes and doubts that arrise arround
    governance of your information assets. We want everyone in your ogranization to
    be able to handle and care for your assets in the safest possible way, regardless

team_section: The company is operated by its founders [Mats Kronbladh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kronbladh/)
  and [Tero Hänninen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terohanninen/). Between us, we have
  more than 40 years of professional experience in our area of expertise. Both of
  the founders met in 2014 and worked together with early Security Operations offerings
  at I Secure Sweden AB. While our careers have taken different paths over the years,
  we've always shared the interest and passion in finding ways to improve the value
  of Security Operations deliveries and finally decided to "throw our hats in the
  ring" to form a company to address the issues that we've been talking about over
  long phone calls over the previous years.

Square the circle. Many of us facing modern Cybersecurity issues can probably relate to the ancient problem of squaring the circle, as the ever changing threat landscape is seemingly impossible to square off and our best efforts end up with approximations.

Squared Circle Security is your partner set to collaborate and create your custom solution – one that can grow with you and pivot fast when things change.
