    Squaring the circle is a problem proposed by ancient geometers. It is the challenge of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.

    Many of us facing Cybersecurity issues can probably relate to this, as the everchanging threat landscape is seemingly impossible to square off.  The best we can do is approximate.

    Therefore, Squared Circle Security is your partner set to collaborate and create your custom solution â€“ one that can grow with you and pivot fast when things change.
