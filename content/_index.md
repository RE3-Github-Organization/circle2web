- title: Square the Circle
  description_markdown: "Squaring the circle is a problem proposed by ancient geometers.
    It is the challenge of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle
    by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.\n\nMany
    of us facing Cybersecurity issues can probably relate to this, as the everchanging
    threat landscape is seemingly impossible to square off.  \n\nTherefore, Squared
    Circle Security is your partner set to collaborate and create your custom solution
    – one that can grow with you and pivot fast when things change."
