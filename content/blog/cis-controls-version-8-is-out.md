Center for Internet Security (CIS) security controls have, for a long while, been seen as the "easy to use" IT-security framework, offering best practice in format that is reasonably actionable, easy to understand and cheap - no ISO 27000 document purchases required.

In many ways the recently (18th of May) released update to version 8 continues on this track - it is still a collection of IT-Security best practices. However, as the framework grows, so does the documentation and complexity.

Let's  have a quick look at the changes and discuss the good, the bads and the uglies.
