    Many organizations are starting their Security Operations journey with a strict focus on monitoring and detection but few have acquired an appropriate capability to react and respond to the cybersecurity incidents.

    Compromises, attacks and incidents may be detected by various sources, such as the internal IT help desk, your infra team or a hosting service provider – but what are your plan when the things get serious? You cannot rely on external IT service providers to manage your security incidents and you should act differently from your IT incident process.

    Squared Circle Security will compass your direction through the CSIR landscape and assist you in establishing an incident response plan with corresponding processes, tools, training and management.

    Starting off with a readiness workshop, we will assess your existing preparations and capabilities by scoring the levels in our incident response maturity model.

  short_markdown: We’ll help you map your progress to find out where you are and build
    a roadmap for your Security Operations future together with you. We can also assess
    and benchmark your current MSSP services and suggest improvements
  content_markdown: "Over the past few years, many organizations has taken the first
    steps towards their Security Operations program. A few has started to build the
    capability internally while the majority seems to rely on external parties providing
    managed services for detecting cybersecurity events.\n\nFrom our viewpoint, the
    market for managed security services has recently exploded, flooding an ever-growing
    range of superlatives from a never-ending number of marketing departments.\n\nReality
    checks are missing and the list of \n\nmore and more unrealistic expectations
    \n\na lot of unrealistic sales buzz around the SOC services offered \n\nexpectations\n\n\nSIEM-centric
    service propositions builds up extensive licensing and operational costs, while
    the value provided seems to go the opposite direction. \n\nManaged security service
    providers (MSSP's) promise a continuous development of new and updated security
    use-cases but refrain from sharing insights and knowledge enabling their customers\n\nWe
    will be your pilot, assist you in navigating your valuable ship through the rough
    waters of cybersecurity\n\n\n---\n\n\n**bold** text\n*italic* text\n\n1. kjkjkjk\n2.
