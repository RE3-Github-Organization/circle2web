- title: Cyber Security Response Readiness
  short_markdown: The true value of Security Operations comes from the efficiency
    of your Incident Response capability. We help you plan, evaluate, improve and
    manage your Incident Response program. Through use of simulation workshops we
    can assess and help you score your readiness.
  content_markdown: |-
    Many organizations start their Security Operations journey with a strict focus on monitoring and detection but few have acquired appropriate capabilities to react and respond to cybersecurity incidents.

    Compromises, attacks and incidents may be detected by various sources, such as the internal IT help desk, infra operations team or a managed hosting service provider – but what is your plan when things get serious? You cannot rely on external IT service providers to manage your security incidents and you should separate your security incidents from your normal IT incident process.

    Squared Circle Security will act as your compass through the CSIRT landscape and assist you in establishing an incident response plan with corresponding processes, tools, training and management.

    Starting off with a readiness workshop, we will assess your existing preparations and capabilities by scoring the levels in our incident response maturity model.

- title: Security Operations Strategy
  short_markdown: We’ll help you map your progress and build a roadmap for your Security
    Operations future. We can also assess and benchmark your current MSSP services
    and suggest improvements.
  content_markdown: "Over the past few years, many organizations has taken the first
    steps towards their Security Operations program. Some have started to build the
    capability internally while the majority seems to rely on external parties providing
    managed security services for detection.\n\nFrom our viewpoint, the market for
    managed security services has recently exploded, flooding an ever-growing range
    of superlatives from a never-ending number of marketing departments. \n\nReality
    checks are few and far between but when actual service deliveries get scrutinized,
    expectations for value propositions are often not met. SIEM-centric service designs
    build up extensive licensing and operational costs, while the value provided seems
    to go the opposite direction. \n\nWe will be your pilot, assist you in navigating
    your valuable ship through the rough Security Operations waters.\n\n- Supporting
    and facilitating your MSSP selection process for managed SOC\n- Reviewing the
    business value and quality testing the actual delivery of your currently contracted
    security services suppliers\n- Building the strategy and roadmap for your internal
    SOC in terms of capabilities, tools and organization\n- Verifying the efficiency
    of your existing security operations program"

    How do you find the proper level of security? There is no one-size-fits-all product with bells and whistles in our shop!

    Information Security is about protecting your business assets and valuables from being stolen, inaccessible or tampered with – by external or internal actors identified through proper threat modelling. Business requirements connected to your information assets are the crucial inputs to a risk analysis process that should manage the security measures to take.

    Many investments around security today rely entirely on technology rather than balancing it with people and processes. Quick-fixes and black-boxes are following each other but the holistic view seems to be missing. The easy way out is often to buy yet another fancy security product rather than invest in training your staff or revisiting your processes.

    - We can assist you with threat modelling that maps the unwanted actors and their possible ways to exploit and misuse your valuable information.

    - We can help you transform your business or specific solution requirements into a security architecture with the proper controls spanning people, process and technology.

    - We can assess an existing security architecture – either your own or the one managed by a potential business partner, or a candidate for merger/acquisition.
