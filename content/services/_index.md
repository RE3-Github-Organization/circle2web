    Many organizations are starting their Security Operations journey with a strict focus on monitoring and detection but few have acquired an appropriate capability to react and respond to the cybersecurity incidents.

    Compromises, attacks and incidents may be detected by various sources, such as the internal IT help desk, your infra team or a hosting service provider – but what are your plan when the things get serious? You cannot rely on external IT service providers to manage your security incidents and you should act differently from your IT incident process.

    Squared Circle Security will compass your direction through the CSIR landscape and assist you in establishing an incident response plan with corresponding processes, tools, training and management.

    Starting off with a readiness workshop, we will assess your existing preparations and capabilities by scoring the levels in our incident response maturity model.

_Circle the square._ We measure, assess and take a pragmatic approach to solving your security needs, considering the sum of your cybersecurity concerns, such as business strategy and planning, monitoring and operations, defenses and controls, technology acquisition, and even training.

We help you to make sense out of your siloed security technologies and help you implement the necessary processes that bring out the maximum value from your already existing security investments. Putting the right security controls in place together with your business, we aim to shift your focus and your budget from chasing constant security infrastructure investments towards more strategic and innovative security projects.
